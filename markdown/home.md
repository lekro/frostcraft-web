# Welcome!

This is FrostCraft, a community-managed advanced technical Minecraft
server. Our main goal is simple: combine technical and aesthetic 
minecraft to the extreme, creating the largest farms possible, and 
try to make our builds look as nice as possible.

## Our server tour!

FrostCraft's core is the survival server. Designs are done in one of the two
creative servers. Creative1 runs Carpet Mod for tech, while creative2 runs
Spigot and building plugins for builders.

## Support FrostCraft on Patreon!

Since FrostCraft is running on a dedicated server, it takes a lot of money
to run! We are running a Patreon campaign to help fund the server.
Please consider donating!
