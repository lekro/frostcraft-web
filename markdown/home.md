# Welcome!

This is the FrostCraft Advanced Technical Server. 
It started as a hermitcraft style server run by CiniTGS, 
and is now an advanced technical server primarily run by 
Blocky. Our main goal is simple: combine technical and aesthetic 
minecraft to the extreme, creating the largest farms possible, and 
try to make our builds look as nice as possible.

FrostCraft's core is the survival server. Designs are done in one of the two
creative servers. Creative1 runs Carpet Mod for tech, while creative2 runs
Spigot and building plugins for builders.

## Support FrostCraft on Patreon!

Since FrostCraft is running on a dedicated server, it takes a lot of money
to run! The owner of the server, Blocky, is running a Patreon campaign to
help fund the server. Please consider donating!
