# Welcome!

This is the FrostCraft Advanced Technical Server. 
It started as a hermitcraft style server run by CiniTGS, 
and is now an advanced technical server primarily run by 
Blocky. Our main goal is simple: combine technical and aesthetic 
minecraft to the extreme, creating the largest farms possible, and 
try to make our builds look as nice as possible.

## *We're looking for builders!!*

While server applications have been closed, we still welcome anyone 
who wants to join our Discord Server. We are however currently looking 
for more builders to contribute. If you want to apply as a Builder,
please contact an Operator, though we would want to get to know you
through Discord before sending you the application link to make sure
that you understand the plans of this server and that you can work well
with our current Build Team. The BT will get the final vote on whether or
not you will be added. You will have to complete *both* the Member and Builder
requirements to be accepted to the server.

## The home of technical and aesthetic puns

FrostCraft's core is the survival server. Designs are done in one of the two
creative servers. Creative1 runs Carpet Mod for tech, while creative2 runs
Spigot and building plugins for builders.

## Support FrostCraft on Patreon!

Since FrostCraft is running on a dedicated server, it takes a lot of money
to run! The owner of the server, Blocky, is running a Patreon campaign to
help fund the server. Please consider donating!
